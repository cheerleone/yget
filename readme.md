rmmd1.1

Simple low argument bash front end for youtube-dl.

Requires 2 arguments:

first argument: l - Low Quality - 360p/480p m - Medium Quality - 720p h - High Quality - 1080p f - Format list

second argument youtube or supported youtube-dl URL

Important, set the rate option inside the script to less than your connection speed.

Notes. Made for those who use youtube-dl many times per hour, but are too lazy to type a host of tacs.

The script first tries a webm video, if that fails it tries mp4.

I'm sure there are more elegant ways of simplifying this script or improving function. It's imperative that only one parameter be passed to initiate a download.
