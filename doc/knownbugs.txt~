  Known Bugs

1.0 none :)


  Known Limitations

2.1 Avoiding bash funk. Add "Quotes" to the URls. If quotes are not used, Youtube URLs containing an & will cause youtube-dl to become a background task causing the shell prompt not to appear until enter is pressed after script completion. This is partly due to the way youtube-dl outputs text during use as a background task. In essence 


  Fixed Bugs

3.1 (Fixed in 3.1.6.beta) Requesting successive downloads of the same video with a different format eg download successfully with h, then try with m or l will result in no further downloads. if you need different formats: manually rename previously downloaded files. - Could Fix, Won't Fix.

3.2 (Fixed in 3.1.7.beta) If the youtube-dl program is running using another process such as "sudo youtube-dl blah" then it will not be detected as running.

3.3 Youtube changed the way they report the format of videos. 
** (altered code to side-step the issue, more reliance is now placed on the returned format from the url query, this has the downside of queries that don't return a format, such as non-youtube links, will produce downloads without an identifying format sudh as 720p)**

  Future Updates

4.1 To properly detect the running state of youtube-dl we should really grep for the python line containing youtube-dl and a known string used always in our download process and not other types of call such as man or forced version updates. Thus constant strings such as "--prefer-free-formats" and "--max-quality" could be used to differentiate.

4.2 Better list sorting: Need push, pop, alpha sort (ascending & descending) & numerical (pick from list to move to top), possibly size.
