  Known Bugs

Avoiding bash funk. Add "Quotes" to the URls. If quotes are not used, Youtube URLs containing an & will cause youtube-dl to become a background task causing the shell prompt not to appear until enter is pressed after script completion. This is due to the way youtube-dl outputs during use even as a background task and some bash weirdness I haven't had time to research.

Youtube changed the way they report some videos. Until one funtion is fixed, the words "unknown format" will appear next to the actual known format.

  Known Limitations

Requesting successive downloads of the same video with a different format eg download successfully with h, then try with m or l will result in no further downloads. if you need different formats: manually rename previously downloaded files. - Could Fix, Won't Fix.
