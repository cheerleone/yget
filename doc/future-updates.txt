  Future Updates

To properly detect the running state of youtube-dl we should really grep for the python line containing youtube-dl and a known string used always in our download process and not other types of call such as man or forced version updates. Thus constant strings such as "--prefer-free-formats" and "--max-quality" could be used to differentiate.
